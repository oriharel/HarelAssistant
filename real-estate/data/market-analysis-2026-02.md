- 4-room garden apartments: priced 3.89-5.29M NIS

## Pricing Analysis

### Our Property Valuation
- Built area: 145 sqm
- Garden: 75 sqm (valued at ~33% of built sqm rate)
- Effective area: 145 + (75 × 0.33) = ~170 sqm
- Effective price/sqm at 5.1M: ~30,000 NIS
- Built-only price/sqm at 5.1M: ~35,170 NIS

### Key Problem: Direct Competitor
- Same 145 sqm, asking 4,370,000 — a gap of **730,000 NIS (17%)**
- 75 sqm garden realistic premium: 250,000-375,000 NIS
- Another garden apartment (210 sqm) at same 5.1M price — buyers will prefer it

### Recommended Pricing
| | List Price | Expected Closing Price |
|--|-----------|----------------------|
| **Recommended** | 4,590,000-4,690,000 | 4,300,000-4,500,000 |

Logic:
- 145 sqm × 30,000 NIS/sqm = 4,350,000 (base value)
- Garden premium (75 sqm): +250,000-350,000
- = 4,600,000-4,700,000 market value
- Negotiation margin: 3%-5%

### Mortgage Impact
At prime 5.5%, mortgage on 70% LTV:
- At 5.1M: 3.57M mortgage → ~18,500 NIS/month
- At 4.5M: 3.15M mortgage → ~16,300 NIS/month
- Difference: 2,200 NIS/month — significant for families

## Strategic Recommendations

### Pricing
- **Current 5.1M is overpriced.** Market data, declining trend, and direct comps all confirm.
- Price reduction to ~4,650,000 recommended. Willing to close at 4,300,000-4,500,000.
- Every month without a sale = value erosion in a declining market.

### Marketing
- Lead with garden photos (75 sqm is the USP)
- Target young families with children
- Headline: emphasize garden size, not just room count
- Facebook: conversational, target local groups, 20:00-22:00 posting
- Yad2: bumps Sunday-Tuesday mornings (9-11), Thursday evenings
- Madlan: weekly refresh

### Timing Context
- Buyer's market: high inventory, high interest, extended marketing times
- Rate cuts expected through 2026 — may improve demand later
- Selling now at competitive price > waiting for market improvement that may not come
